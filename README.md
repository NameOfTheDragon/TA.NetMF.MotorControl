# Netduino Object Oriented Motor Control #

This project implements various types of motor control for Microsoft .NET Micro Framework in C#. The primary use case is the control of stepper motors using Netduino hardware and the Adafruit motor shield. Support for other platforms/shields may be added in future.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Stepper motors are objects, too! There is a lot of micro-framework code out htere that looks like it was written in Fortran in the 1960s. We have tried to take a more object oriented approach to this library. We are striving to maintain 'clean code' and to make operations asynchronous where it makes sense.

### How do I get set up? ###

The projects are configured for Netduino Plus hardware. You should be able to clone the code, build it in Visual Studio 2012 or later and deploy it to your Netduino Plus.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* We love unit tests, but haven't found a good way of doing that with micro-framework projects. We would love some contribution in this area.
* We invite and encourage pull requests. Each request will undergo code review before being merged.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner/admin: Tim Long (Tigra Astronomy)
